# Royal Dinner Party

*A solo card game of Royal Dinner Guest feasting.*

## Objective
Your goal is to feed all 12 Dinner Guests (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) by serving them Meals they enjoy before you run out of cards.

---

## The Setup (Setting the Table)

1. **Create the Dinner Table:**
    - From a shuffled deck (with jokers), create a 3x3 grid of face-up number cards, leaving one space open in the middle as a Free Space. This is your Dinner Table.
2. **Set Guests & Favors Aside:**
    - As you create the Dinner Table, place any Dinner Guests into a pile, and then any Chef’s favors (Aces and Jokers) you draw into a separate pile.
3. **Seat the Dinner Guests:**
    - Take any Dinner Guests you set aside and place them at the "table"—in an empty space outside your 3x3 grid, adjacent to a Dinner Table card. A Dinner Guest always sits next to the card they are most interested in:
        - The highest value card of their suit.
        - If no match, the highest value card of their color.
        - If still no match, the simply highest value card on the grid.
        - If there's a tie, you choose where they sit.
4. **Keep Your Favors:**
    - Place any Aces and Jokers you drew face-up nearby. These are your Chef's Favors.
5. **Final Touch:**
    - You may swap one Dinner Table card with a new card from the top of the deck.

## How to Play

On your turn, draw one card from the shuffled deck:

- **If it's a Number Card (2-10):**
    - You must place it onto a stack in the Dinner Table. It can only be placed on a card of equal or lower value. This action may trigger Serving a Dinner Guest.
- **If it's a Dinner Guest (J, Q, K):**
    - A new guest has arrived. Seat them at the table using the "most interested in" rule in The Setup.
- **If it's an Ace or Joker:**
    - Add it to your collection of Chef's Favors.

## Serving a Dinner Guest

Placing a card in your Dinner Table can create an opportunity to serve a meal:

1. **Identify the Meal:**
    - When you place a card, look at the Dinner Guest sitting directly opposite that spot (with two Dinner Table cards between them).
2. **Serve the Cards:**
    - The two cards between your newly placed card and the Dinner Guest make up the Meal. (The card you just played is not part of the Meal, and therefore isn’t required to follow any rules regarding Dinner Guest interest).
3. **Check their Appetite:**
    - To satisfy a Dinner Guest, the sum of the two Meal cards must meet or beat the Dinner Guest's Appetite.

### Dinner Guest Appetites & Preferences

- **Jacks:** Appetite 11. Not picky; will eat a Meal of any suit.
- **Queens:** Appetite 12. Require the two cards in the Meal to match their color (red or black).
- **Kings:** Appetite 13. Demand both cards in the Meal match their suit (Spades, Hearts, etc.).

A satisfied Dinner Guest is turned face-down (naptime!). Their seat remains occupied for the rest of the game.

## Chef's Favors (Aces & Jokers)

You can use a Favor at any time on your turn (before you draw your card, before you place a drawn card, after you’ve placed or used a card, etc). Once used, turn it face-down/discard.

- **Ace (Send it back to the kitchen):**
    - Pick up any one stack of cards from the Dinner Table and place it facedown on the bottom of the draw deck, leaving an empty space on the table. This acts like your starting Free Space and lets you place any numbered card to start a new pile.
- **Joker (Re-Plating):**
    - Move the top card of one Dinner Table stack to another valid spot on the grid. This can trigger Serving a Dinner Guest.

---

## Problem Scenarios

- **If you can't place a card:**
    - If you draw a number card that has no valid spot in the Dinner Table, you must give it to a Dinner Guest as an Extra Helping. The Dinner Guest "most interested" in that card receives it. Add the card's value to their Appetite, making them harder to satisfy.
        - When seeing which Dinner Guest wants the extra helping, simply replace “highest” with “lowest” in the “most interested in” priority list (i.e. a 2❤️ can’t be placed, so it gets served to the LOWEST Dinner Guest of the same suit, and then so on through the list)
        - A Dinner Guest whose Appetite reaches 20 or more can never be satisfied. You lose.
- **If the draw deck runs out:**
    - If the deck is empty, you have no more Chef’s Favors, and not all 12 Dinner Guests are satisfied, then you lose.

## Winning and Scoring

- **Victory:** You win instantly when all 12 spaces around the Dinner Table are filled with satisfied, face-down Dinner Guests.
- **Score:** Your score is the number of unused Chef's Favors you have left. A perfect score is 6.

## Changing the Difficulty

Here are a few ways to make the game easier or harder:

- Change the order that you place the initial Royals:
    - Place them face down as you set the table, then draw one at a time from the pile of Dinner Guests and follow placement rules
    - Start with Jacks, then Queens, and then Kings (or go in reverse!)
    - ~untested~ The Dinner Guests aren’t helpful and instead sit in front of meals they are LEAST interested in (What a pain!)
- Add/Remove Chef’s Favors from the deck
- Omit Step 5. Final Touch from The Setup
